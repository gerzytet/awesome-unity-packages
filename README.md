# Awesome Unity Packages

Hi! My name is Jeffrey Lanters! I've been a Unity developer since 2012 and started open sourcing my project via modules on GitHub in 2020. This inspired my to create an awesome list of other awesome open source Unity packages from all over GitHub.

Inspired on many other [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists. Please take a quick gander at the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/awesome-unity-packages/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/awesome-unity-packages/graphs/contributors), you're awesome! If you've noticed a package on the list that is no longer maintained or is not a good fit, please submit a pull request to improve to keep things awesome. Thank you!
